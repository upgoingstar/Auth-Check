# Auth-Check
Checks from a list of URLs, if they are accessible without login or not. Allows you to search a specific regex pattern in the response and returns True (if pattern matches in response) and returns false otherwise. 

You can also specify the website name (use -t or --target) and pass the complete directory listing for the same.

Use -o for nameing your own output file.
